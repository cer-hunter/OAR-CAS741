\section{Reference Material}

This section records information for easy reference.

\subsection{Table of Units}

Throughout this document SI (Syst\`{e}me International d'Unit\'{e}s) is employed
as the unit system.  In addition to the basic units, several derived units are
used as described below.  For each unit, the symbol is given followed by a
description of the unit and the SI name.
~\newline

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
%\begin{table}[ht]
  \noindent \begin{tabular}{l l l} 
    \toprule		
    \textbf{symbol} & \textbf{unit} & \textbf{SI}\\
    \midrule 
    px & pixel & picture element\\
  \end{tabular}
  %	\caption{Provide a caption}
%\end{table}

\plt{Only include the units that your SRS actually uses.}

\plt{Derived units, like newtons, pascal, etc, should show their derivation
    (the units they are derived from) if their constituent units are in the
    table of units (that is, if the units they are derived from are used in the
    document).  For instance, the derivation of pascals as
     is shown if newtons and m are
    both in the table.  The derivations of newtons would not be shown if kg and
    s are not both in the table.}

\plt{The symbol for units named after people use capital letters, but the name
  of the unit itself uses lower case.  For instance, pascals use the symbol Pa,
  watts use the symbol W, teslas use the symbol T, newtons use the symbol N,
  etc.  The one exception to this is degree Celsius.  Details on writing metric
  units can be found on the 
  \href{https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/writing-metric-units}
  {NIST} web-page.}

\subsection{Table of Symbols}

The table that follows summarizes the symbols used in this document along with
their units.  The choice of symbols was made to be consistent with the heat
transfer literature and with existing documentation for solar water heating
systems.  The symbols are listed in alphabetical order.

\subsection{Mathematical Notation}

\plt{This section is optional, but should be included for projects that make use
  of notation to convey mathematical information.  For instance, if typographic
  conventions (like bold face font) are used to distinguish matrices, this
  should be stated here.  If symbols are used to show mathematical operations,
  these should be summarized here.  In some cases the easiest way to summarize
  the notation is to point to a text or other source that explains the
  notation.}

\plt{This section was added to the template because some students use very
  domain specific notation.  This notation will not be readily understandable to
  people outside of your domain.  It should be explained.}

\newpage

\pagenumbering{arabic}

\plt{This SRS template is based on \citet{SmithAndLai2005, SmithEtAl2007,
  SmithAndKoothoor2016}.  It will get you started.  You should not modify the
  section headings, without first discussing the change with the course
  instructor.  Modification means you are not following the template, which
  loses some of the advantage of a template, especially standardization.
  Although the bits shown below do not include type information, you may need to
  add this information for your problem.  If you are unsure, please can ask the
  instructor.}

\plt{Feel free to change the appearance of the report by modifying the LaTeX
  commands.}

\plt{This template document assumes that a single program is being documented.
  If you are documenting a family of models, you should start with a commonality
  analysis.  A separate template is provided for this.  For program
  families you should look at \cite{Smith2006, SmithMcCutchanAndCarette2017}.
  Single family member programs are often programs based on a single physical
  model.  General purpose tools are usually documented as a family.  Families of
  physical models also come up.}

\plt{The SRS is not generally written, or read, sequentially.  The SRS is a
  reference document.  It is generally read in an ad hoc order, as the need
  arises.  For writing an SRS, and for reading one for the first time, the
  suggested order of sections is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal Statement
\item Instance Models
\item Requirements
\item Introduction
\item Specific System Description
\end{itemize}
}

\plt{Guiding principles for the SRS document:
\begin{itemize}
\item Do not repeat the same information at the same abstraction level.  If
  information is repeated, the repetition should be at a different abstraction
  level.  For instance, there will be overlap between the scope section and the
  assumptions, but the scope section will not go into as much detail as the
  assumptions section.
\end{itemize}
}

\plt{The template description comments should be disabled before submitting this
  document for grading.}

\plt{You can borrow any wording from the text given in the template.  It is part
  of the template, and not considered an instance of academic integrity.  Of
  course, you need to cite the source of the template.}

\plt{When the documentation is done, it should be possible to trace back to the
  source of every piece of information.  Some information will come from
  external sources, like terminology.  Other information will be derived, like
  General Definitions.}

\plt{An SRS document should have the following qualities: unambiguous,
  consistent, complete, validatable, abstract and traceable.}

\plt{The overall goal of the SRS is that someone that meets the Characteristics
  of the Intended Reader (Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}) can learn,
  understand and verify the captured domain knowledge.  They should not have to
  trust the authors of the SRS on any statements.  They should be able to
  independently verify/derive every statement made.}

\section{Introduction}

Images often contain important information to be used in many different modern applications. One such type 
of information that can be contained within images are readable characters, and the motivation for the Optical Alphabet 
Recognition project is to create a system from scratch, that can classify upper-case English letter characters characters accurately.
More information about the problem itself can be found within the Problem Statement document. Furthermore, a foundational goal of
this project is to be useful for educating people about the fundamentals of image classification.

The following section is an overview of the Software Requirement Specifications for the OAR project, specifically outlining the 
purpose of the document, the scope of the requirements, characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of the 
document.

\subsection{Purpose of Document}

The purpose of this SRS document is to establish and clearly communicate the requirements, limitations, definitions, and models, 
in regards to the OAR project. This document will also serve as basis for reference for the rest of the documents 
supporting the project. 

\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 

The scope for this project is constrained to the recognition of images of handwritten and printed capital-letter English
alphabet characters, in their correct orientations. This does not include hand-written cursive letters.
See the assumptions section (Section 4.2.1) for further details.

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}

Readers of this document are intended to have a basic level understanding of 2D image 
processing techniques (equivalent to a standard undergraduate course on machine learning). However, readers with
a prerequisite of at least level one university mathematics knowledge (specifically including matrix linear algebra) will
be able to understand and follow most of the concepts in the document, as the project is also intended to be a useful tools
for learning about image processing.

\subsection{Organization of Document}

  This SRS document contains an introduction to the problem being addressed by the software,
  and the overarching goals of the project. It is to be used as reference for readers based on the
  SRS template by Smith and Lai(2005); Smith et al.(2007). The scope, terminology, definitions
  and models used in the project are outlined, and more details about the specifics of the problem and the explored
  solution are presented. Requirements, potential future changes and traceability information are also defined.

\section{General System Description}

This section provides general information about the system.  It identifies the
interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user
characteristics and lists the system constraints.  

\subsection{System Context}

\plt{Your system context will include a figure that shows the abstract view of
  the software.  Often in a scientific context, the program can be viewed
  abstractly following the design pattern of Inputs $\rightarrow$ Calculations
  $\rightarrow$ Outputs.  The system context will therefore often follow this
  pattern.  The user provides inputs, the system does the calculations, and then
  provides the outputs to the user.  The figure should not show all of the
  inputs, just an abstract view of the main categories of inputs (like material
  properties, geometry, etc.).  Likewise, the outputs should be presented from
  an abstract point of view.  In some cases the diagram will show other external
  entities, besides the user.  For instance, when the software product is a
  library, the user will be another software program, not an actual end user.
  If there are system constraints that the software must work with external
  libraries, these libraries can also be shown on the System Context diagram.
  They should only be named with a specific library name if this is required by
  the system constraint.}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{SystemContextFigure}
\caption{System Context}
\label{Fig_SystemContext} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\begin{itemize}
\item User Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Provide an image of a character to the program in the proper orientation.
\item Be able to interact with the software program using a keyboard, computer mouse, and monitor.
\item Run the software on a system with the capabilities to sufficently process computer graphics.
\end{itemize}
\item OAR Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Provide the ability to load or change image files to be classified.
\item Detect and warn about invalid or corrupt image files, upon input.
\item Display the confidence in the result of classified characters.
\item Provide a user interface which is able to take user input at anytime, with minimal down time where the program is unresponsive.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Characteristics} \label{SecUserCharacteristics}

The end user of the OAR software is anyone who can use character recognition software or wants to learn about it. This may include 
the intended readers of this document (as described in Section 2.3), however none of those reader requirements are neccessary 
to use the software.

\subsection{System Constraints}

The only real world design constraint for this project is that all input images must have the character in their proper legible
orientation.

\section{Specific System Description}

This section first presents the problem description, which gives a high-level
view of the problem to be solved.  This is followed by the solution characteristics
specification, which presents the assumptions, theories, definitions and finally
the instance models.  

\subsection{Problem Description} \label{Sec_pd}

OAR is intended to classify the characters in images according to their corresponding English language
alphabet characters. It should be able to do this with a high level of confidence that the classifcation is correct.

\subsubsection{Terminology and  Definitions}

\plt{This section is expressed in words, not with equations.  It provide the
  meaning of the different words and phrases used in the domain of the problem.
The terminology is used to introduce concepts from the world outside of the
mathematical model  The terminology provides a real world connection to give the
mathematical model meaning.}

This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent
sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it
easier to correctly understand the requirements:

\begin{itemize}

\item 

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Physical System Description} \label{sec_phySystDescrip}

\plt{The purpose of this section is to clearly and unambiguously state the
  physical system that is to be modelled. Effective problem solving requires a
  logical and organized approach. The statements on the physical system to be
  studied should cover enough information to solve the problem. The physical
  description involves element identification, where elements are defined as
  independent and separable items of the physical system. Some example elements
  include acceleration due to gravity, the mass of an object, and the size and
  shape of an object. Each element should be identified and labelled, with their
  interesting properties specified clearly. The physical description can also
  include interactions of the elements, such as the following: i) the
  interactions between the elements and their physical environment; ii) the
  interactions between elements; and, iii) the initial or boundary conditions.}

The physical system of \progname{}, as shown in Figure~?,
includes the following elements:

\begin{itemize}

\item[PS1:] 

\item[PS2:] ...

\end{itemize}

\plt{A figure here makes sense for most SRS documents}

% {
%  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{<FigureName>}
% }
% \caption{\label{<Label>} <Caption>}
% \end{center}
% \end{figure}

\subsubsection{Goal Statements}

\plt{The goal statements refine the ``Problem Description''
  (Section~\ref{Sec_pd}).  A goal is a functional objective the system under
  consideration should achieve. Goals provide criteria for sufficient
  completeness of a requirements specification and for requirements
  pertinence. Goals will be refined in Section “Instanced Models”
  (Section~\ref{sec_instance}). Large and complex goals should be decomposed
  into smaller sub-goals.  The goals are written abstractly, with a minimal
  amount of technical language.  They should be understandable by non-domain
  experts.}

\noindent Given an image, the goal statements are:

\begin{itemize}

\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_meaningfulLabel}:] Reprocess the image such that classifying
calculations can be performed on the image.

\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_meaningfulLabel}:] Calculate and display the predicted 
corresponding character label for the unknown character in the image.

 \item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_meaningfulLabel}:] Calculate and display the confidence level that
 the predicted label is correct.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solution Characteristics Specification}

This section provides the assumptions, theoretical models, instance models, general definitions,
and data constraints. The information in this section is intended to reduce ambiguity about the project and 
to present the problem in clear mathethematical or logical terms.

\plt{This section presents the solution characteristics by successively refining
  models.  It starts with the abstract/general Theoretical Models (TMs) and
  refines them to the concrete/specific Instance Models (IMs).  If necessary
  there are intermediate refinements to General Definitions (GDs).  All of these
  refinements can potentially use Assumptions (A) and Data Definitions (DD).
  TMs are refined to create new models, that are called GMs or IMs. DDs are not
  refined; they are just used. GDs and IMs are derived, or refined, from other
  models. DDs are not derived; they are just given. TMs are also just given, but
  they are refined, not used.  If a potential DD includes a derivation, then
  that means it is refining other models, which would make it a GD or an IM.}

\plt{The above makes a distinction between ``refined'' and ``used.'' A model is
  refined to another model if it is changed by the refinement. When we change a
  general 3D equation to a 2D equation, we are making a refinement, by applying
  the assumption that the third dimension does not matter. If we use a
  definition, like the definition of density, we aren't refining, or changing
  that definition, we are just using it.}

\plt{The same information can be a TM in one problem and a DD in another.  It is
  about how the information is used.  In one problem the definition of
  acceleration can be a TM, in another it would be a DD.}

\plt{There is repetition between the information given in the different chunks
  (TM, GDs etc) with other information in the document.  For instance, the
  meaning of the symbols, the units etc are repeated.  This is so that the
  chunks can stand on their own when being read by a reviewer/user.  It also
  facilitates reuse of the models in a different context.}

\noindent \plt{The relationships between the parts of the document are show in
  the following figure.  In this diagram ``may ref'' has the same role as
  ``uses'' above.  The figure adds ``Likely Changes,'' which are able to
  reference (use) Assumptions.}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[scale=0.9]{RelationsBetweenTM_GD_IM_DD_A.pdf}
\end{figure}

The instance models that govern \progname{} are presented in
Subsection~\ref{sec_instance}.  The information to understand the meaning of the
instance models and their derivation is also presented, so that the instance
models can be verified.

\subsubsection{Assumptions} \label{sec_assumpt}

\plt{The assumptions are a refinement of the scope.  The scope is general, where
  the assumptions are specific.  All assumptions should be listed, even those
  that domain experts know so well that they are rarely (if ever) written down.}
\plt{The document should not take for granted that the reader knows which
  assumptions have been made. In the case of unusual assumptions, it is
  recommended that the documentation either include, or point to, an explanation
  and justification for the assumption.}
\plt{If it helps with the organization and understandability, the assumptions can be presented as sub sections.  The following sub-sections are options: background theory assumptions, helper theory assumptions, generic theory assumptions, problem specific assumptions, and rationale assumptions}

This section simplifies the original problem and helps in developing the
theoretical model by filling in the missing information for the physical system.
The numbers given in the square brackets refer to the theoretical model [TM],
general definition [GD], data definition [DD], instance model [IM], or likely
change [LC], in which the respective assumption is used.

\begin{itemize}

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_meaningfulLabel}:]
  \plt{Short description of each assumption.  Each assumption
    should have a meaningful label.  Use cross-references to identify the
    appropriate traceability to TM, GD, DD etc., using commands like dref, ddref
    etc.  Each assumption should be atomic - that is, there should not be an
    explicit (or implicit) ``and'' in the text of an assumption.}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Models}\label{sec_theoretical}

\plt{Theoretical models are sets of abstract mathematical equations or axioms
  for solving the problem described in Section ``Physical System Description''
  (Section~\ref{sec_phySystDescrip}). Examples of theoretical models are
  physical laws, constitutive equations, relevant conversion factors, etc.}

\plt{Optionally the theory section could be divided into subsections to provide more structure and improve understandability and reusability.  Potential subsections include the following: Context theories, background theories, helper theories, generic theories, problem specific theories, final theories and rationale theories.}

This section focuses on the general equations and laws that \progname{} is based
on.  \plt{Modify the examples below for your problem, and add additional models
  as appropriate.}

\plt{``Ref.\ By'' is used repeatedly with the different types of information.
  This stands for Referenced By.  It means that the models, definitions and
  assumptions listed reference the current model, definition or assumption.
  This information is given for traceability.  Ref. By provides a pointer in the
  opposite direction to what we commonly do.  You still need to have a reference
  in the other direction pointing to the current model, definition or
  assumption.  As an example, if TM1 is referenced by GD2, that means that GD2 will
  explicitly include a reference to TM1.}

~\newline

\subsubsection{General Definitions}\label{sec_gendef}

\plt{General Definitions (GDs) are a refinement of one or more TMs, and/or of
  other GDs.  The GDs are less abstract than the TMs.  Generally the reduction
  in abstraction is possible through invoking (using/referencing) Assumptions.
  For instance, the TM could be Newton's Law of Cooling stated abstracting.  The
  GD could take the general law and apply it to get a 1D equation.}

This section collects the laws and equations that will be used in building the
instance models.

\plt{Some projects may not have any content for this section, but the section
  heading should be kept.}  \plt{Modify the examples below for your problem, and
  add additional definitions as appropriate.}

\plt{This may be necessary when the necessary information does not fit in the
  description field.}
\plt{Derivations are important for justifying a given GD.  You want it to be
  clear where the equation came from.}

\subsubsection{Data Definitions}\label{sec_datadef}

\plt{The Data Definitions are definitions of symbols and equations that are
  given for the problem.  They are not derived; they are simply used by other
  models.  For instance, if a problem depends on density, there may be a data
  definition for the equation defining density.  The DDs are given information
  that you can use in your other modules.}

\plt{All Data Definitions should be used (referenced) by at least one other
  model.}

This section collects and defines all the data needed to build the instance
models. The dimension of each quantity is also given.  \plt{Modify the examples

                $T_C$ is the temperature of the coil.  $T_W$ is the temperature of the water.  
                The heat flux out of the coil, $q_C$, is found by
                assuming that Newton's Law 
                of Cooling applies (\aref{A_Newt_coil}).  This law (\dref{NL}) is used on the surface of
                the coil, which has area $A_C$ and heat 
                transfer coefficient $h_C$.  This equation
                assumes that the temperature of the coil is constant over time (\aref{A_tcoil}) and that it does not vary along the length
                of the coil (\aref{A_tlcoil}).

\subsubsection{Data Types}\label{sec_datatypes}

\plt{This section is optional.  In many scientific computing programs it isn't
  necessary, since the inputs and outpus are straightforward types, like reals,
  integers, and sequences of reals and integers.  However, for some problems it
  is very helpful to capture the type information.}

\plt{The data types are not derived; they are simply stated and used by other
  models.}

\plt{All data types must be used by at least one of the models.}

\plt{For the mathematical notation for expressing types, the recommendation is
  to use the notation of~\citet{HoffmanAndStrooper1995}.}

This section collects and defines all the data types needed to document the
models. \plt{Modify the examples below for your problem, and add additional
  definitions as appropriate.}

\subsubsection{Instance Models} \label{sec_instance}    

\plt{The motivation for this section is to reduce the problem defined in
  ``Physical System Description'' (Section~\ref{sec_phySystDescrip}) to one
  expressed in mathematical terms. The IMs are built by refining the TMs and/or
  GDs.  This section should remain abstract.  The SRS should specify the
  requirements without considering the implementation.}

This section transforms the problem defined in Section~\ref{Sec_pd} into 
one which is expressed in mathematical terms. It uses concrete symbols defined 
in Section~\ref{sec_datadef} to replace the abstract symbols in the models 
identified in Sections~\ref{sec_theoretical} and~\ref{sec_gendef}.

The goals \plt{reference your goals} are solved by \plt{reference your instance
  models}.  \plt{other details, with cross-references where appropriate.}
\plt{Modify the examples below for your problem, and add additional models as
  appropriate.}

\subsubsection*{Derivation of ...}

\plt{The derivation shows how the IM is derived from the TMs/GDs.  In cases
  where the derivation cannot be described under the Description field, it will
  be necessary to include this subsection.}

\subsubsection{Input Data Constraints} \label{sec_DataConstraints}    

Table~\ref{TblInputVar} shows the data constraints on the input output
variables.  The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations
on the range of values that can be taken by the variable.  The column for
software constraints restricts the range of inputs to reasonable values.  The
software constraints will be helpful in the design stage for picking suitable
algorithms.  The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the
flexibility to experiment with unusual situations.  The column of typical values
is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario.  The uncertainty column
provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be
measured.  This information would be part of the input if one were performing an
uncertainty quantification exercise.

The specification parameters in Table~\ref{TblInputVar} are listed in
Table~\ref{TblSpecParams}.

\subsubsection{Properties of a Correct Solution} \label{sec_CorrectSolution}

\noindent
A correct solution must come in the form of one of the 26 possible labels,
\{A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z\}, as well as an associated confidence level, as a percentage, that the
label assigned is correct.

\section{Requirements}

\plt{The requirements refine the goal statement.  They will make heavy use of
  references to the instance models.}

This section provides the functional requirements, the business tasks that the
software is expected to complete, and the nonfunctional requirements, the
qualities that the software is expected to exhibit.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] Accept an input image in the following formats: \begin{itemize}
  \item PNG (Portable Net Graphics)
  \item JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
  \item BMP (Bitmap)
  \item preloaded training images
\end{itemize}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_OutputInputs}:] Process the image such that the calculations
needed to be performed by the program can be executed.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Calculate}:] Calculate and display the classified label for the input image.

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_VerifyOutput}:] Calculate and display the confidence level that the assigned
label is correct.

\end{itemize}

\plt{Every IM should map to at least one requirement, but not every requirement
  has to map to a corresponding IM.}

\subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Accuracy}:]
  \textbf{Accuracy} The accuracy of the computed label confidence should be consistent enough that the results 
  could be considered comparable to other existing solutions for this problem. As such the confidence level output has to
  be calculated in a similar way to existing solutions so that the output can be verified and compared.

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Usability}:] \textbf{Usability}
  The user should be able to intuitively use the software and understand the output that is displayed.
  To accomplish this the software should be user-friendly, simple, and require little setup. A user survey
  may be conducted to verify the software's percieved usability.

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Maintainability}:]
  \textbf{Maintainability & Understandability} The code should be clear and understandable to make further development by other programmers 
  possible with little hassle, as well as to help educate newer programmers as to how image classification works.
  Adding further features, or understanding how the software presently works should not be a difficult task.


\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Portability}:]
  \textbf{Portability} The software should be cross-platform (Windows, Linux, MacOS) with little to no setup
  required. This can be in the the form of an executable python-based application.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rationale}

\plt{Provide a rationale for the decisions made in the documentation.  Rationale
should be provided for scope decisions, modelling decisions, assumptions and
typical values.}

\section{Likely Changes}

The changes listed below are likely to be implemented as the software is developed further.

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:] Expand the number of classification labels
to include lower-case English letter alphabet, numerical, and punctuation characters. 
\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:] Allow the user to specify whether the image is being
input from a camera or from a pre-existing file on their system.

\end{itemize}

\section{Unlikely Changes}    

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:] Expand the functionality of the program to classify
whole English words and sentences instead of just individual characters.
\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:] Provide the choice of different image classifciation algorithms.


\end{itemize}

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}

The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a
component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked
with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.  Table~\ref{Table:trace} shows the
dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, and
instance models with each other. Table~\ref{Table:R_trace} shows the
dependencies of instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each
other. Table~\ref{Table:A_trace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, and likely changes on
the assumptions.

\plt{You will have to modify these tables for your problem.}

\plt{The traceability matrix is not generally symmetric.  If GD1 uses A1, that
  means that GD1's derivation or presentation requires invocation of A1.  A1
  does not use GD1.  A1 is ``used by'' GD1.}

\plt{The traceability matrix is challenging to maintain manually.  Please do
  your best.  In the future tools (like Drasil) will make this much easier.}

The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on
what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  The
arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an
arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a
component is changed, the components that it points to should also be
changed. Figure~\ref{Fig_ATrace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, likely changes, and
assumptions on each other. Figure~\ref{Fig_RTrace} shows the dependencies of
instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each other.
